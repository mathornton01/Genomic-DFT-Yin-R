# Genomic-DFT-Yin-R Package
This is a simple R-Package that allows for the user to implement the DFT distance calculations and phylogeny building 
procedures that are initially discussed in Yin and Yau 2014, and extended in Yin and Yau 2015.  To install and load 
the R Library see the installation section. 

## Installation 

In order to install R-libraries directly from Github, the user must first install the devtools library with: 
```r
install.packages('devtools'); 
```
Once the devtools package has been installed, the user can load the library using the standard 'library' or 'require' functions
then from the devtools package the user can install the Genomic-DFT-Yin-R-Package by using the 'install_github' function. 
```r
library(devtools); 
```
