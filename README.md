# Genomic-DFT-Yin-R Package
This is a simple R-Package that allows for the user to implement the DFT distance calculations and phylogeny building 
procedures that are initially discussed in Yin and Yau 2014, and extended in Yin and Yau 2015.  To install and load 
the R Library see the installation section. 

#Installation
